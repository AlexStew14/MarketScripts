# MarketScripts
 
This is a collection of scripts that use mathematical models and options information to provide stock insights using real market data.  
Data is sourced from either Yahoo Finance or the TD Ameritrade API with Yahoo Finance being less accurate but not requiring an API token.  

This repository is not financial advice.
